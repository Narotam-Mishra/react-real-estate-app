## [React Real Estate App]
- Welcome to the React Real Estate App. This application is designed to showcase properties, provide detailed listings, and offer user profiles for a seamless real estate browsing experience.

### Features

- Home Page : Start exploring properties right from the home page. It offers a curated selection of featured listings to catch the user's attention.

- Listings Page : Dive deeper into available properties with our Listings Page. Browse through a comprehensive list of properties with filter options to refine your search according to your preferences.

- Single Property Page : Get detailed information about a specific property by visiting its dedicated page. From images to descriptions, everything you need to know is just a click away.

- Profile Page: Users can create profiles to save their favorite properties, track their search history, and manage their preferences for a personalized experience.

### Technologies Used (Frontend)

- [React](https://react.dev/) : The app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) : We use React Router for declarative routing to navigate between different pages in the app.

- [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) : React Leaflet provides bindings between React and Leaflet. It does not replace Leaflet, but leverages it to abstract Leaflet layers as React components. As such, it can behave differently from how other React components work.

- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styling of the pages, I have used SCSS. SCSS stands for "Sassy CSS" (or "Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets"). It is a preprocessor scripting language that is a superset of CSS. This means that all valid CSS is also valid SCSS, but SCSS has additional features and capabilities that CSS does not.
